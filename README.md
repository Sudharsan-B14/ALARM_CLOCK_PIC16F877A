# ALARM_CLOCK_PIC16F877A
# RTC-Based Medication Reminder using PIC Microcontroller

This project is designed to alert people by setting alarm using a PIC microcontroller and an RTC module.

## 🧰 Components Used
- PIC16F877A
- DS1307 RTC
- LCD 16x2
- Buzzer
- Push buttons
- Power supply

## 🔧 Features
- Time-based alerts
- LCD display of medication schedule
- Buzzer notification

## 🧪 How It Works
The system uses RTC to keep track of real-time. At the scheduled time, the buzzer alerts the user, and the LCD shows the alert.
